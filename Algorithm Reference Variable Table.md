Certainly! Here's the Algorithm Reference Variable Table:

### Algorithm Reference Variable Table

This table is used for translating high-level logical conditions into algorithmic steps.

| Variable Name | Description                                 | Data Type  | Example Value |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| UserAge       | Age of the user.                            | Integer    | 28            |
| UserBalance   | Account balance of the user.                | Float      | 1000.45       |
| IsLoggedIn    | Indicates whether the user is logged in.   | Boolean    | true          |
| PurchaseTotal | Total amount of a user's purchase.          | Float      | 75.99         |
| IsAdmin       | Indicates whether the user has admin rights. | Boolean  | false         |
| DiscountCode  | Discount code applied by the user.          | String     | "SAVE10"      |
| ProductCount  | Number of products in the user's cart.     | Integer    | 5             |

**Explanation of Fields:**

- **Variable Name**: The name or identifier of the reference variable.
- **Description**: A brief description of the variable and its purpose in the algorithm.
- **Data Type**: The data type of the variable (e.g., Integer, String, Boolean, Float).
- **Example Value**: An example value or representation of the variable's content.

These reference variables are used within algorithms to make decisions and perform calculations based on the values stored in them. They serve as placeholders for data that may change during the execution of the algorithm, allowing for dynamic and context-aware processing.
