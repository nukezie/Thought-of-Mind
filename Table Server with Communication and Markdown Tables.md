### Table Server with Communication and Markdown Tables

#### 1. Define Table Structure

- Start by defining the structure of the tables you'll use to store data. You can use Python dictionaries or lists to represent tables. Each table should have a unique name, and each row should have a unique identifier (e.g., a timestamp).

    | Table Name | Structure                             |
    |------------|---------------------------------------|
    | table_data | {'table1': [], 'table2': [], ...}     |

#### 2. Mathematical Calculations

- Write functions for the mathematical calculations you want to perform. These functions will take input data, perform calculations, and return results.

    ```python
    def calculate_square(number):
        return number * number

    def calculate_sum(a, b):
        return a + b

    # Add more calculation functions
    ```

#### 3. API Threading

- Use the `threading` module in Python to create and manage threads. Each thread will perform a specific task, such as running calculations and updating tables.

    ```python
    import threading

    # Define a thread for a specific task
    def calculation_thread(number, result_table):
        result = calculate_square(number)
        result_table.append(result)

    # Create and start threads
    threads = []
    for i in range(1, 6):
        result_table = table_data['table1']
        thread = threading.Thread(target=calculation_thread, args=(i, result_table))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    ```

#### 4. Inter-Communication

- Threads can communicate and share data through the shared table structure. They can read from and write to tables as needed.

    ```python
    # Reading data from a table
    table1_data = table_data['table1']

    # Writing data to a table
    table_data['table2'].append(result)

    # Ensure proper synchronization when accessing tables from multiple threads
    ```

#### 5. Scheduling and Time Sequencing

- You can use the `time` module to schedule and sequence tasks. For example, you can schedule certain calculations to run periodically.

    ```python
    import time

    # Schedule a calculation to run every 5 seconds
    while True:
        result_table = table_data['table1']
        calculation_thread(10, result_table)
        time.sleep(5)
    ```
