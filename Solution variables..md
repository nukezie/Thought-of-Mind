These variables are related to building a Table Server with communication, mathematical calculations, and Markdown tables, as discussed earlier. Each variable serves a specific purpose and contributes to the functionality of the system.

Example usage:
- `table_data` is a dictionary used to store tables and their data.
- `calculate_square` and `calculate_sum` are functions for mathematical calculations.
- `threading` is a Python module for creating and managing threads.
- `calculation_thread` represents a specific task that can be executed in a thread.
- `result_table` is used to store the results of calculations.
- `table1_data` is an example of accessing data from a table.
- `time` is a module for handling time-related tasks.

These variables and their integration are essential components of the Table Server system described earlier.
