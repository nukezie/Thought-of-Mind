### Logic Table Coding Report

This table is used to document the coding details related to logic conditions and triggers within an application or system.

| Condition Name     | Code Description                                    | Code Example                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Login Authentication | Code for validating user credentials during login. | ```if (username && password) { /* Authentication logic */ }``` |
| Account Verification | Code for verifying user's email or phone number.   | ```if (emailVerified && phoneNumberVerified) { /* Verification logic */ }``` |
| Payment Processing  | Code for handling payment transactions securely.   | ```try { /* Payment processing logic */ } catch (PaymentError) { /* Error handling */ }``` |
| Content Access Control | Code for controlling access to premium content or features. | ```if (userRole === 'Premium') { /* Allow access */ } else { /* Deny access */ }``` |
| Notification Delivery | Code for sending notifications to users.           | ```for (user in notificationList) { /* Send notification logic */ }``` |
